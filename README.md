# Movies API

# Purpose

Hello and welcome to my movies API! My objective was to build the server-side component of a movies web application. 

# What will it do?
The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
